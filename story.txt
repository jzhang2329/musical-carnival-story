One day, a monkey wants to go to a musical carnival, but he runs into a river. He drinks tons of water. And a lion walks by. Then the monkey picks up a piece of rock and climbs up the tree. And then, he throws the rock at the lion. The lion is very angry. Suddenly, the monkey falls from the tree. The lion roars as he runs.
