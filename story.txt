One day, a monkey wants to go to a musical carnival, but he runs into a river. He drinks tons of water. And a lion walks by. Then the monkey picks up a piece of rock and climbs up the tree. And then, he throws the rock at the lion. The lion is very angry. Suddenly, the monkey falls from the tree. The lion roars as he runs.

The lion caught the monkey and killed it. The monkey's blood was all over the lion's body.

The lion then saw that the monkey had three children who were hiding in the trees.  The monkeys were frightened by the sight of their
dead mother, whose body was left mangled by the river.  The lion thought about letting the baby monkeys go, but the lion was still full
of rage from the rock that had landed on his left shoulder.  Full of bloodlust, the lion tore down every tree in the forest, until the baby 
monkeys were forced out into the open fields.  Naked and vulnerable, the monkeys had no where left to hide.  The baby monkeys were cornered 
into a dark cave, forced to face this beast who had brutally stolen the life of their beloved mother, and now planned to do the same to them.    
The monkeys begged for forgiveness, but it was no use.  The lion was blind to reason, and could not hear the monkeys' cries.

The lion then proceeded to carry the monkeys to a cliff. The monkeys were hung off the cliff, being held in the lion's mouth. The lion was about to drop
the baby monkeys when a twist of fate occurred. As the lion began to loosen its grip, a silverback gorilla happened to be on the otherside of the cliff.
He then surprises the lion and grabs it by the neck and throws the lion off the cliff while grabbing the baby monkeys.
